License: CC0
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may
 be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
 ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
 include, but are not limited to, the following:
 .
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
       communicate, and translate a Work;
 .
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
       performer(s);
 .
  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
       likeness depicted in a Work;
 .
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
       Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse
       of data in a Work;
 .
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
       of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
       on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
       implementation thereof, including any amended or successor
       version of such directive); and
 .
  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
       world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
       implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
 contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
 permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
 surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
 associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
 (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
 of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
 limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
 "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of
 the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
 successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
 revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
 or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
 public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants
 to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
 exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
 any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
 or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
 and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
 with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
      abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
      document.
 .
   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
      statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties
      of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
      infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects,
      accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
      discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under
      applicable law.
 .
   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
      persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
      without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in
      the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for
      obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights
      required for any use of the Work.
 .
   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is
      not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with
      respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
