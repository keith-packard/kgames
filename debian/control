Description: Venerable selection of Xaw-based games
 These are a selection of various games that use the Xaw toolkit. They
 are all from the 80's and 90's and look the part. As a result, they
 are also very lightweight. There are a bunch of solitaire (patience)
 variants, mille bournes, cribbage and dominos.
